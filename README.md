device: a webcamera, a computer
software: processing(nyar4psg lib, oscP5 lib)
the two QR codes(already provides with PNG in the folder)
Notice: the two QR code should stay in the same horizontal plane, otherwise it doesn't work well. I'm planning to make it OK for the small QR code to move to different horizontal planes, hope I can make it before 3/01.
